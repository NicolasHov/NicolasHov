# Hello, I'm Nicolas 👋

- 📱 💻 I'm a Javascript developer (ReactJS, RN, VueJS, ExpressJS, Ts, NodeJS) [Check out my portfolio](https://nicolashov.github.io/)

- 🏔 I'm also curious about languages like Rust 🦀 (I co-organize a monthly meetup in Brussels) or WebAsssembly 🕸️ (check my [slides](https://nicolashov.github.io/wasm-with-rust-slides/) and tools like NixOs ❄️ (see my [configuration file](https://github.com/NicolasHov/nixfiles))

- 🍰 I'm currently working part-time at becode.org as coach on the FullStack cursus, before that I worked at the bootcamp [Matrice.io](https://matrice.io/) as lead-teacher of the FullStack cursus. In the past I worked on projects like [this serious game](https://gitlab.com/la-boussole/gaoblaze/track/-/graphs/master)

- ♻️ I've been curating a bit about [schools of code and learning to code](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1317409507761324033) 

- 💬 Let's discuss ! [Book a meeting](https://calendly.com/hovart-nicolas/30min) or let's meet in Brussels 🇧🇪 or Paris 🇫🇷 !

# Hello, I'm Nicolas 👋

- 📱 💻 I'm a Javascript developer (ReactJS, RN, ExpressJS, Ts, NodeJS) [Check out my portfolio](https://nicolashov.github.io/)

- 🍰 I'm currently working at [Matrice.io](https://matrice.io/), before that I worked on [Tiramisu](https://github.com/cppccn/trms) or [this serious game](https://gitlab.com/la-boussole/gaoblaze/track/-/graphs/master) (sadly, I'm not in the app credits... but that's another story)

- ♻️ I've been curating a bit about [schools of code and learning to code](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1317409507761324033) 

- 💬 Let's discuss ! [Book a meeting](https://calendly.com/hovart-nicolas/30min)

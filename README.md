# Hello, I'm Nicolas 👋

- 📱 💻 I'm a Javascript developer (ReactJS, RN, ExpressJS, Ts, NodeJS) [Check out my portfolio](https://nicolashov.github.io/)

- 🍰 I'm currently looking for a job, before that I worked at the bootcamp [Matrice.io](https://matrice.io/) as manager of the FullStack cursus. In the past I worked on [this serious game](https://gitlab.com/la-boussole/gaoblaze/track/-/graphs/master)

- 🏔 I'm curious about new languages like Rust 🦀 and new tools like NixOs ❄️

- ♻️ I've been curating a bit about [schools of code and learning to code](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1317409507761324033) 

- 💬 Let's discuss ! [Book a meeting](https://calendly.com/hovart-nicolas/30min)
